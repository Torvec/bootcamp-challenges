# My React Portfolio
A UC Berkley Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp Week 20 Challenge

## Description

The week 20 bootcamp challenge was to create another portfolio website but this time using React. I took it a little further and went with Vite and added on Tailwind CSS just to make things more challenging.
